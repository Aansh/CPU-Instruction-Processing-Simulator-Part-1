# CPU-Instruction-Processing-Simulator-Part-1
The intent of this project is the simulate CPU instruction processing life cycle.

In this initial part of the project I create a simulator that imitates working of simple in-order CPU 

which executes instructions step by step as they arrive without any performance tuning.

It shows how an instruction is worked upon in each stage of instruction processing life cycle. 

They are 5 stages involved in executing an instruction viz. Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory and Write Back. 

The simulator takes each instruction through every stage in order of input and displays the result after each step.
